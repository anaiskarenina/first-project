My first data analysis project

Here I wanted to practice my data analysis skills.

I chose a csv file created by the government of the City of Buenos Aires. The csv file compiles the calls received by the #137 (phone number for domestic violence cases). 

My goal was to explore the data, clean it and find relationships between the different variables.

All comments and corrections are welcome!
